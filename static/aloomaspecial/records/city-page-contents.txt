Frequently Asked Questions<h2>
<list>
Can I put mixed trash in a concrete dumpster?
No, a concrete dumpster rental in #State is strictly for clean masonry materials like concrete, brick, or asphalt. Mixing in wood, plastic, or general trash creates contamination that prevents recycling and may result in significant fees.^^
How do I pay for the rental?

Rain can saturate debris like carpet and wood, increasing the total weight. We recommend covering your waste management dumpster rental around #State with a tarp during storms to avoid potential overage charges.^^
